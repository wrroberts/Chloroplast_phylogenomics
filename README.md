# Workflow for the phylogenomic analysis of chloroplast genomes

### The chloroplast genomes were assembled separately using either SPAdes or GetOrganelle. They were annotated using GESeq, followed by manual checking of start/stop codons and inspection of correct gene positions.

### The following workflow starts with genomes in GenBank format and follows steps for data cleaning, alignment, and phylogenetic analyses.
